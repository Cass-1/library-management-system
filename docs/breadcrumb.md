# Breadcrumb

Im a little worried that the ./ here needs to be somehow changed to an absolute import but im not sure
`"test": "npx tsx --env-file=development.env ./node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs"`

Next steps:

- write some more database test cases
- im currently trying to get the userController working with the create route in the user express.js route
